# LLM Testing for Brand Name Evaluator

This document provides instructions for testing the LLM integration in the Brand Name Evaluator component, specifically the context-based shortlisting functionality.

## Testing the LLM Integration

The `test_llm_call.py` script has been created to test whether the LLM is being called correctly in the context-based shortlisting process. This script:

1. Creates mock evaluation data for four brand names
2. Sets up a mock brand context
3. Initializes the BrandNameEvaluator with a mock Supabase client
4. Directly calls the `_context_based_shortlisting` method
5. Outputs the results and verifies that the shortlisting was successful

## Running the Test

To run the test, execute:

```bash
python test_llm_call.py
```

### Expected Output

If successful, you should see output similar to:

```
Calling _context_based_shortlisting method...
Context-based shortlisting selected names: Lumina, Zenith, Nexus
Shortlisted 3 brand names:
- Lumina
- Zenith
- Nexus
First shortlisted name evaluation comments: [Detailed comments with rationale]
Test completed successfully!
```

## What the Test Verifies

This test confirms that:

1. The LLM is properly initialized and accessible
2. The prompt formatting for the LLM is correct
3. The LLM can be successfully called
4. The response is parsed correctly
5. The shortlisting logic works as expected
6. The evaluation comments are updated with the shortlisting rationale

## Troubleshooting

If the test fails, check:

1. API keys: Ensure the Google API key in settings is valid
2. Import issues: Verify all required modules are imported correctly
3. Response parsing: Confirm the JSON response from the LLM is being parsed correctly
4. Exception handling: Look at what exceptions are being thrown

## Recent Changes and Fixed Issues

Recent changes to the codebase included:
- Updating field types in the state model from float to Any for visual_branding_potential
- Modifying the process_evaluation function to handle string values
- Ensuring proper imports for HumanMessage and SystemMessage
- Maintaining consistency between the model definition and actual usage

All these changes have been verified to work correctly with the LLM.
