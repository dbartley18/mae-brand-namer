    "etymology": "The word origin and history",
    "descriptiveness": 7,
    ...other fields with exact names...
  }
  ```
  
  Example of INCORRECT format (don't do this):
  ```
  {
    "analysis": {
      "meaning": "The meaning of the term",
      "word_origin": "The etymology"
    },
    "scores": {
      "descriptive_score": 7
    }
  }
  ```
