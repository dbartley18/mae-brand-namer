     - Word formation process
     - Morpheme analysis
     - Structural transparency
     - Derivational potential
     - Inflectional properties

  3. Semantic Properties
     - Core meaning
     - Semantic associations

  Format your analysis according to this schema:
  {format_instructions}

  IMPORTANT: You must respond with a valid JSON object that matches EXACTLY the schema provided.
  The JSON MUST contain all the fields specified below at the TOP LEVEL of the object.
  Do NOT nest fields under additional keys or create your own object structure.
  Use EXACTLY the field names provided in the schema - do not modify, merge, or rename any fields.
  Do not include any preamble or explanation outside the JSON structure.
  Do not use markdown formatting for the JSON.

  Example of correct structure:
  {
    "pronunciation_ease": "text here",
    "euphony_vs_cacophony": "text here",
    ... other fields exactly as named ...
  }

  For each brand name, provide:
  - Detailed linguistic breakdown
  - Potential strengths/weaknesses
  - Risk assessment
  - Improvement suggestions
  - Overall linguistic score
