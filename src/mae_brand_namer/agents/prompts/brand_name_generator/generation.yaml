  NAMING CATEGORY: {category}
  
  Apply the naming strategy for {category} names:
  
  1. Descriptive Names
     - Direct description of offering
     - Benefit-focused terms
     - Industry-relevant terminology

  2. Suggestive Names
     - Metaphorical connections
     - Emotional associations
     - Value proposition hints

  3. Abstract Names
     - Coined words
     - Letter combinations

  Previously generated names (YOU MUST AVOID THESE):
  {existing_names}

  CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Generate only ONE brand name that is COMPLETELY UNIQUE compared to all previously generated names. The name should not be:
  - A duplicate of any previously generated name (even with different capitalization or spacing)
  - A minor variation of any previously generated name (changing just 1-2 letters)
  - A substring of any previously generated name
  - Sharing the same root words as any previously generated name
  - Phonetically similar to any previously generated name
  
  For example, if "Lumina" was previously generated, do not suggest "Luminar", "Illumina", "LuminaTech", etc.
  
  Do not provide multiple options or alternatives.
  
  For the ONE brand name you generate, provide:
  - The brand name itself
  - Naming category and rationale (must be: {category})
  - Brand personality alignment (how it connects to the brand personality)
  - Brand promise alignment (how it reflects the brand promise)

  - Target audience relevance details (provide 2-3 bullet points explaining the score)
  - Market differentiation score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)

  - Name generation methodology used
  - Rank (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)

  Format your response according to this schema:
  {format_instructions}

  IMPORTANT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. For all score fields (target_audience_relevance_score, market_differentiation_score, etc.):
     - Provide these as single numeric values from 1-10 (e.g., 8 or 8.0)
     - DO NOT wrap scores in quotes or arrays
  
  2. For all details fields (target_audience_relevance_details, market_differentiation_details, etc.):
     - Provide these as strings containing 2-3 bullet points
     - Format as "• First point\n• Second point\n• Third point"

  Ensure the name:
  - Is unique and ownable
