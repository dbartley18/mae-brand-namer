  Generate ONE strategic brand name based on the following brand context.
  
  Brand Context:
  {brand_context}
  
  Brand Values:
  {brand_values}
  
  Brand Purpose:
  {purpose}
  
  Key Attributes:
  {key_attributes}

  NAMING CATEGORY: {category}
  
  Apply the naming strategy for {category} names:
  
  1. Descriptive Names
     - Direct description of offering
     - Benefit-focused terms
     - Industry-relevant terminology

  2. Suggestive Names
     - Metaphorical connections
     - Emotional associations
     - Value proposition hints

  3. Abstract Names
     - Coined words
     - Letter combinations
     - Sound symbolism

  4. Experiential Names
     - Action words
     - Sensory elements
     - Emotional triggers

  Previously generated names (YOU MUST AVOID THESE):
  {existing_names}

  CRITICAL UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT: Generate only ONE brand name that is COMPLETELY UNIQUE compared to all previously generated names. The name should not:
  - Be a duplicate of any previously generated name (even with different capitalization or spacing)
  - Be a minor variation of any previously generated name (changing just 1-2 letters)
  - Be a substring of any previously generated name
  - Share the same root words as any previously generated name
  - Be phonetically similar to any previously generated name
  - Use a different suffix/prefix but the same core word (e.g., if "Lumina" exists, don't use "Illumina", "LuminaTech", etc.)
  - Be a plural or singular variation of an existing name
  - Be a compound word that includes an existing name
  
  UNIQUENESS STRATEGIES:
  - Create a completely new word with a different syllable structure
  - Draw from a different conceptual or linguistic domain
  - Use a different language influence than previous names
  - Consider entirely different phonetic patterns
  - Use a different number of syllables than previous names
  
  Do not provide multiple options or alternatives.
  
  For the ONE brand name you generate, provide:
  - The brand name itself
  - Naming category and rationale (must be: {category})
  - Brand personality alignment (how it connects to the brand personality)
  - Brand promise alignment (how it reflects the brand promise)
  - Target audience relevance score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)
  - Target audience relevance details (provide 2-3 explanatory bullet points as text)
  - Market differentiation score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)
  - Market differentiation details (provide 2-3 explanatory bullet points as text)
  - Memorability score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)
  - Memorability score details (provide 2-3 explanatory bullet points as text)
  - Pronounceability score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)
  - Pronounceability score details (provide 2-3 explanatory bullet points as text)
  - Visual branding potential score (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)
  - Visual branding potential details (provide 2-3 explanatory bullet points as text)
  - Name generation methodology used
  - Rank (provide as a SINGLE NUMERIC VALUE from 1-10)

  Format your response according to this schema:
  {format_instructions}

  IMPORTANT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. For all scores (target_audience_relevance_score, market_differentiation_score, memorability_score, pronounceability_score, visual_branding_potential_score):
     - Provide these as single numeric values from 1-10
     - Example: 8 or 8.0 (not as a string or array)
  
  2. For all details fields (target_audience_relevance_details, market_differentiation_details, etc.):
     - Provide these as text with 2-3 bullet points separated by newlines
     - Example: "- First point about this\n- Second point about this\n- Third point if needed"

  Ensure the name:
  - Is unique and ownable
  - Aligns with brand strategy
  - Has digital potential
  - Is globally viable
