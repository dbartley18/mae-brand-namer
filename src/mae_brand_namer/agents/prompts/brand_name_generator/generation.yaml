  Apply the naming strategy for {category} names:

  1. Descriptive Names:
     Definition: These names directly communicate what the brand does, offers, or sells.
     Characteristics:
     - Immediately clear about product/service offering
     - Easy to understand and remember
     - May be harder to trademark due to being generic
     - Direct description of offering
     - Benefit-focused terms
     - Industry-relevant terminology
     Examples: Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube, General Electric, American Airlines

  2. Evocative/Suggestive Names:
     Definition: These names hint at the brand's essence, benefits, personality, or positioning without explicitly describing what the product or service is. They evoke a feeling, idea, or image.
     Characteristics:
     - More emotional and less literal than descriptive names
     - Create stronger brand identity and emotional connection
     - Require more marketing to educate consumers about offerings
     - Metaphorical connections
     - Emotional associations
     - Value proposition hints
     Examples: Nike (Greek goddess of victory), Amazon (vast rainforest), Patagonia (rugged outdoors), Nest (home security), Dove (gentleness)

  3. Invented/Coined/Abstract Names:
     Definition: These names are completely made up and have no inherent meaning before being associated with the brand.
     Characteristics:
     - Highly distinctive and memorable because they are unique
     - Offer the most flexibility in brand positioning
     - Require significant marketing to build meaning
     - Coined words
     - Letter combinations
     - Sound symbolism
     Examples: Kodak, Xerox, Verizon, Google, Acura

  4. Experiential Names:
     Definition: These names focus on the experience the brand provides to the customer.
     Characteristics:
     - Customer-centric and benefit-oriented
     - Create strong emotional connection by focusing on user needs
     - Action words
     - Sensory elements
     - Emotional triggers
     Examples: Oracle (wisdom, guidance), Salesforce (empowering sales teams), Red Bull (energy), LinkedIn (professional connection)

  5. Founder/Personal Names:
     Definition: These names are based on the name of the founder, owner, or a significant person associated with the brand.
     Characteristics:
     - Convey authenticity, heritage, and personal connection
     - Leverage the reputation of the individual
     - May become limiting if the brand expands beyond the founder's identity
     Examples: McDonald's, Disney, Johnson & Johnson, Ben & Jerry's, Mercedes-Benz

  6. Geographic Names:
     Definition: These names are derived from a location, region, city, or geographical feature.
     Characteristics:
     - Evoke a sense of place, origin, or specific qualities of that location
     - May be relevant for brands with a regional focus
     - Might be limiting if the brand expands globally
     Examples: Arizona Tea, Fuji Film, Cisco Systems, Kentucky Fried Chicken, London Fog

  7. Symbolic Names:
     Definition: These names rely on symbolism or abstract concepts rather than direct description.
     Characteristics:
     - Powerful and memorable if symbolism aligns with brand values
     - May require effort to establish connection between name and offering
     - Use symbols, metaphors, or concepts that resonate with brand values
     Examples: Apple, Shell, Target, Starbucks
