  CRITICAL EVALUATION GUIDELINES:
  - Use the FULL range of scores from 1-10, where:
    * 1-3 = Poor/Problematic
    * 4-5 = Below average/Needs significant improvement
    * 6-7 = Average/Acceptable
    * 8 = Good
    * 9 = Excellent
    * 10 = Exceptional (rarely given)
  - Be genuinely critical and discriminating in your assessment
  - Not all brand names deserve high scores - most will be average
  - Identify concrete weaknesses, not just strengths
  - Consider both immediate appeal and long-term viability
  - Evaluate each dimension independently (don't inflate all scores)
  - Do NOT give high scores (8+) unless truly warranted with specific evidence
  - The shortlist_status field should be left as FALSE for all evaluations

  For each name, provide scores (1-10) and rationale for:
  - Strategic alignment
  - Distinctiveness
  - Brand fit
  - Positioning strength
  - Memorability
  - Pronounceability
  - Meaningfulness
  - Visual potential
  - Domain viability
  - Overall score

  Ensure your evaluation aligns with the fields defined in the brand_name_evaluation table:
  - strategic_alignment_score
  - distinctiveness_score
  - competitive_advantage
  - brand_fit_score
  - positioning_strength
  - memorability_score
  - pronounceability_score
  - meaningfulness_score
  - phonetic_harmony
  - visual_branding_potential
  - storytelling_potential
  - domain_viability_score
  - overall_score
  - shortlist_status
  - evaluation_comments
