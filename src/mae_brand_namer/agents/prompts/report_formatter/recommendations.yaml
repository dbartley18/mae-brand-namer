  Based on this comprehensive data, develop detailed strategic recommendations that include:

  1. Final Name Recommendations
     - Present the top 1-3 recommended brand names in ranked order
     - Support each recommendation with specific data-backed strengths
     - Show how each recommended name aligns with brand strategy and objectives
     - Compare recommended names against competitors

  2. Implementation Strategy
     - Outline steps for implementing the new brand name
     - Discuss potential trademark and legal considerations
     - Suggest messaging for internal and external communications
     - Provide timeline recommendations for rollout

  3. Risk Management
     - Identify potential challenges or issues with recommended names
     - Present mitigation strategies for each identified risk
     - Address any regional or cultural concerns
     - Discuss contingency plans if needed

  4. Next Steps
     - Recommend immediate actions to move forward
     - Suggest any additional research or testing if necessary
     - Outline key decision points in the implementation process
     - Provide metrics for measuring successful implementation

  The recommendations should be actionable, strategic, and business-focused.
  Use formal, professional language appropriate for senior executives.
  Support all recommendations with specific data points from the analysis.
  Focus on practical implementation rather than theoretical considerations.
