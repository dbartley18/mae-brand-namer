  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Competitor Analysis Data: {{competitor_analysis}}
  Format Instructions: {{format_instructions}}

  DATA STRUCTURE:
  The data follows this structure based on the CompetitorAnalysis model:
  {
    "competitor_analysis": {
      "BrandName1": {  // Dictionary mapping brand names to competitors
        "Competitor1": {  // Dictionary mapping competitor names to CompetitorDetails
          "risk_of_confusion": 7,  // Integer (1-10)
          "competitor_strengths": "Detailed description of strengths", // String
          "competitor_weaknesses": "Detailed description of weaknesses", // String
          "competitor_positioning": "Description of market positioning", // String
          "trademark_conflict_risk": "Assessment of trademark risk", // String
          "target_audience_perception": "How target audience perceives this competitor", // String
          "competitor_differentiation_opportunity": "Opportunities for differentiation" // String
        },
        "Competitor2": {
          // Same structure as above
        }
      },
      "BrandName2": {
        // Same structure as above
      }
    }
  }

  Please format the competitor analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the competitor analysis methodology and its importance for brand naming strategy
  2. For each brand name, provides a consolidated analysis of its competitive landscape including:
     - Overview of relevant competitors
     - Competitor positioning assessment
     - Analysis of competitor strengths and weaknesses
     - Differentiation opportunities against competitors
     - Risk of confusion with competitors
     - Target audience perception in competitive context
     - Trademark conflict risk assessment

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with an overview of the competitive landscape before presenting the specific analysis for each brand name.
