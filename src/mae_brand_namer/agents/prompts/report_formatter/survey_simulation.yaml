  # IMPORTANT: This survey_data contains extremely rich information about each persona who responded to the survey. Make sure to include as much of this data as possible in your analysis.

  Please analyze the simulated survey data to provide comprehensive insights on how each brand name would be received by the target audience. Your analysis should include:

  1. **Methodology Overview**: Explain the methodology used for the survey simulation
  
  2. **Detailed Persona Profiles**: For each simulated persona, include:

     - Decision-making authority and style
     - Key pain points and challenges
     - Goals and priorities
     - Information sources and content consumption habits
     - Current brand relationships
     - Buying process and preferences
  
  3. **Brand Promise Perception**: For each name, include the exact brand_promise_perception_score and detailed analysis of how well each name communicates the brand promise
  
  4. **Personality Fit Analysis**: Include the exact personality_fit_score and analyze alignment with desired brand personality traits
  
  5. **Emotional Associations**: Include verbatim emotional_association responses where available
  
  6. **Competitive Positioning**: Include the exact competitive_differentiation_score and evaluate how distinctly each name positions the brand against competitors
  
  7. **Market Adoption Potential**: Include the exact simulated_market_adoption_score and assess the likelihood of market acceptance for each name
  
  8. **Verbatim Qualitative Feedback**: Include extensive direct quotes from the raw_qualitative_feedback including:
     - Relevance
     - Memorability
     - Differentiation
     - First Impression
     - Potential Concerns
     - Target Audience Appeal
  
  9. **Final Recommendations**: Include the exact final_survey_recommendation from each persona

  For each brand name, provide a comprehensive analysis of the simulated survey results that will help decision-makers understand how target audiences might respond to each option. Do not summarize or paraphrase the qualitative feedback when direct quotes are available - use the actual language from the personas.
