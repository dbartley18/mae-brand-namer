  # IMPORTANT: Include as much specific data as possible from the provided domain_data in your analysis.

  Please analyze the domain availability and digital presence potential for each brand name. Your analysis should include:

  1. **Domain Availability Assessment**: 
     - Evaluate availability of primary domains (.com, .net, .org) for each name
     - Check for exact matches and close variations
     - Analyze the potential impact of unavailable domains on brand strength

  2. **Alternative TLDs Exploration**: 
     - Recommend industry-specific or innovative TLDs that might be suitable
     - Assess the viability of country-specific domains if relevant for international markets
     - Consider non-traditional TLDs (e.g., .io, .co, .ai) that might enhance brand positioning

  3. **Domain History Investigation**: 
     - Research the history of any previously registered domains with the same or similar names
     - Evaluate any potential reputation issues or SEO advantages/disadvantages
     - Assess whether acquiring previously used domains is feasible or recommended

  4. **SEO Potential Analysis**: 
     - Evaluate keyword value and search volume potential
     - Assess how each domain might perform in search results
     - Consider domain length, memorability, and typability for SEO impact

  5. **Social Media Availability**: 
     - Check username availability across major platforms (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.)
     - Assess the impact of unavailable usernames on brand consistency
     - Recommend strategies for maintaining brand consistency across platforms

  6. **Technical Considerations**: 
     - Identify potential technical issues with certain domain names
     - Assess email deliverability considerations
     - Evaluate potential for typosquatting or cybersquatting risks

  7. **Future-proofing Strategy**: 
     - Recommend comprehensive domain portfolio strategies
     - Suggest preemptive registrations to protect the brand
     - Outline a long-term domain management approach

  For each brand name, provide a thorough domain analysis with actionable recommendations that decision-makers can use to assess the digital viability of each name option.
