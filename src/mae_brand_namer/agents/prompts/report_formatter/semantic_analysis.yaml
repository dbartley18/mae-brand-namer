  Your task is to create a well-structured semantic analysis section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Semantic Analysis Data: {{semantic_analysis}}
  
  Format Instructions: {{format_instructions}}

  Please format the semantic analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the semantic analysis methodology and importance
  2. For each brand name, provides detailed analysis of all fields in the model:
     - Etymology (etymology)
     - Sound symbolism (sound_symbolism)
     - Brand personality (brand_personality)
     - Emotional valence (emotional_valence)
     - Denotative meaning (denotative_meaning)
     - Figurative language (figurative_language)
     - Phoneme combinations (phoneme_combinations)
     - Sensory associations (sensory_associations)
     - Word length and syllables (word_length_syllables)
     - Alliteration and assonance (alliteration_assonance)
     - Compounding and derivation (compounding_derivation)
     - Semantic trademark risk (semantic_trademark_risk)

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of semantic analysis and its importance in brand naming before presenting the analysis for each name.
