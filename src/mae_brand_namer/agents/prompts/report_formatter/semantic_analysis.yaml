  Your task is to create a well-structured semantic analysis section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}

  The data is organized by brand name, with semantic analysis for each name.

  Please format the semantic analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the semantic analysis methodology and importance
  2. For each brand name, provides detailed analysis of:
     - Denotative meaning
     - Etymology
     - Emotional valence
     - Brand personality association
     - Sensory associations
     - Figurative language elements
     - Phoneme combinations
     - Sound symbolism
     - Alliteration and assonance
     - Word length and syllable structure
     - Compounding and derivation aspects
     - Semantic trademark risk assessment

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of semantic analysis and its importance in brand naming before presenting the analysis for each name.
