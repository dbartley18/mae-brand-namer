  Your task is to create a well-structured translation analysis section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Translation Analysis Data: {{translation_analysis}}

  The data is organized by brand name, then by target language, with translation analysis for each name in multiple languages.

  Please format the translation analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the translation analysis methodology and its importance for global branding
  2. For each brand name, provides a consolidated analysis across all target languages including:
     - Direct translation issues and opportunities
     - Semantic shift across languages
     - Pronunciation difficulties in different language groups
     - Phonetic retention across languages
     - Cultural acceptability in different regions
     - Adaptation needs and proposed adaptations
     - Assessment of how well brand essence is preserved in translation
     - Recommendations for global consistency vs. localization
     - Additional translation notes

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of translation considerations in global brand deployment before presenting the analysis for each name.
