  Your task is to create a well-structured translation analysis section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Translation Analysis Data: {{translation_data}}
  Format Instructions: {{format_instructions}}

  DATA STRUCTURE:
  The data is organized as a nested dictionary where the first level keys are brand names, the second level keys are languages, and the values are detailed translation analyses:
  {
    "translation_analysis": {
      "BrandName1": {
        "Language1": {
          "notes": "Notes on the translation and cultural considerations",
          "semantic_shift": "Description of any semantic shift in translation",
          "target_language": "The target language for translation",
          "adaptation_needed": true,
          "direct_translation": "Direct translation of the brand name",
          "phonetic_retention": "Phonetic retention score and comments",
          "proposed_adaptation": "Proposed adaptation for better cultural fit",
          "cultural_acceptability": "Cultural acceptability of the translation",
          "brand_essence_preserved": "How well the brand essence is preserved",
          "pronunciation_difficulty": "Difficulty of pronunciation in the target language",
          "global_consistency_vs_localization": "Balance between global consistency and localization"
        },
        "Language2": {
          // Same structure of fields as Language1
        }
      },
      "BrandName2": {
        // Same structure as BrandName1
      }
    }
  }

  Please format the translation analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the importance of translation analysis for global brand naming
  2. For each brand name, provides a comprehensive analysis across different languages, including:
     - Direct translations and phonetic retention
     - Adaptation needs and proposed adaptations
     - Cultural acceptability in each target market
     - Pronunciation difficulties
     - Brand essence preservation
     - Balance between global consistency and local adaptability
  3. Identifies patterns and key insights from translations across languages
  4. Provides recommendations for internationalization strategy

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
