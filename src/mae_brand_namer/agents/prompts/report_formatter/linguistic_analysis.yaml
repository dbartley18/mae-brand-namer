  Your task is to create a well-structured linguistic analysis section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Linguistic Analysis Data: {{linguistic_analysis}}
  Format Instructions: {{format_instructions}}

  DATA STRUCTURE:
  The data follows this structure based on the LinguisticAnalysis model:
  {
    "linguistic_analysis": {
      "BrandName1": {  // Dictionary mapping brand names to LinguisticAnalysis objects
        "notes": "Notes on the linguistic aspects of the brand name", // String
        "word_class": "Word class of the brand name", // String
        "sound_symbolism": "Sound symbolism associated with the brand name", // String
        "rhythm_and_meter": "Rhythm and meter of the brand name", // String
        "pronunciation_ease": "Ease of pronunciation for the brand name", // String
        "euphony_vs_cacophony": "Euphony versus cacophony of the brand name", // String
        "inflectional_properties": "Inflectional properties of the brand name", // String
        "neologism_appropriateness": "Appropriateness of the brand name as a neologism", // String
        "overall_readability_score": "Overall readability score of the brand name", // String
        "morphological_transparency": "Morphological transparency of the brand name", // String
        "naturalness_in_collocations": "Naturalness of the brand name in collocations", // String
        "ease_of_marketing_integration": "Ease of marketing integration for the brand name", // String
        "phoneme_frequency_distribution": "Phoneme frequency distribution in the brand name", // String
        "semantic_distance_from_competitors": "Semantic distance from competitors for the brand name" // String
      },
      "BrandName2": {
        // Same structure as above
      }
    }
  }

  Please format the linguistic analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the linguistic analysis methodology and importance
  2. For each brand name, provides detailed analysis of:
     - Pronunciation ease (use pronunciation_ease field)
     - Euphony vs. cacophony (use euphony_vs_cacophony field)
     - Rhythm and meter (use rhythm_and_meter field)
     - Phoneme frequency distribution (use phoneme_frequency_distribution field)
     - Sound symbolism (use sound_symbolism field)
     - Word class (use word_class field)
     - Morphological transparency (use morphological_transparency field)
     - Inflectional properties (use inflectional_properties field)
     - Ease of marketing integration (use ease_of_marketing_integration field)
     - Naturalness in collocations (use naturalness_in_collocations field)
     - Semantic distance from competitors (use semantic_distance_from_competitors field)
     - Neologism appropriateness (use neologism_appropriateness field)
     - Overall readability score (use overall_readability_score field)
     - Additional linguistic notes (use notes field)

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of linguistic analysis and its importance in brand naming before presenting the analysis for each name.
