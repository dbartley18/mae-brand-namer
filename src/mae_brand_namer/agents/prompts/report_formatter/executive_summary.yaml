  Original User Request: "{user_prompt}"

  Number of Shortlisted Names: {len(shortlisted_names) if shortlisted_names else 0}
  
  Brand Context Summary:

  {brand_context}
  ```

  Based on the data provided, craft a professional executive summary that includes:

  1. Introduction and Brand Overview
     - Begin with a clear statement of what this report covers: "This report summarizes the brand naming analysis conducted to identify a compelling and effective name for [type of business based on brand context]."
     - Describe the brand's mission and purpose (e.g., "The brand empowers [target audience] to achieve [key benefits] through [services/solutions].")
     - List the key brand personality traits that the name needs to reflect
     - Explain the broader business context for this naming project

  2. Project Overview and Objectives
     - Clearly articulate the key objectives of the naming project (3-4 bullet points)
     - Examples: "Develop a brand name that reflects the brand's mission, values, and target audience"
     - "Identify a name that is memorable, unique, and relevant to the [specific market]"
     - "Ensure the name aligns with the brand's desired positioning as [positioning statement]"
     - Highlight the key parameters that guided the brand naming process

  3. Methodology Summary
     - Describe the systematic approach used in the naming process, mentioning:
     - Understanding brand context (personality, promise, target audience)
     - Generation of diverse name options ({total_names} names generated)
     - Evaluation criteria (relevance, memorability, uniqueness, availability)
     - Shortlisting process ({len(shortlisted_names) if shortlisted_names else 0} names shortlisted)

  4. Key Findings and Insights
     - Present the most significant discoveries from the naming process
     - Highlight patterns or trends observed across analysis types
     - Note the total number of brand names generated and evaluated
     - Introduce the shortlisted names with a sentence like: "{len(shortlisted_names) if shortlisted_names else 0} names were shortlisted as strong candidates:"
     - For each shortlisted name (up to 3), include:
       * The name itself (in bold)
       * A one-sentence description of what the name communicates
       * Key strengths of the name based on analysis

  5. Top Recommendations
     - Identify the most suitable brand name(s) based on comprehensive analysis
     - Provide clear rationale for these recommendations
     - Include any relevant implementation considerations

  6. Strategic Implications
     - Explain how the recommended name(s) align with business objectives
     - Discuss potential market impact and competitive advantages
     - Address any risks or challenges to consider

  The executive summary should be comprehensive yet concise, approximately 500-700 words.
  Use formal business language appropriate for C-level executives.
  Do not include extraneous details or technical jargon without explanation.
  Focus on insights rather than methodology.

  Return the executive summary as a JSON object with these keys:
