  Your task is to create an executive summary for a brand naming report with the following information:

  Run ID: {run_id}
  Original User Request: "{user_prompt}"
  Total Brand Names Generated: {total_names}
  Number of Shortlisted Names: {shortlisted_names | length}
  
  Brand Context:

  Sections Data:
  {sections_data}

  Based on this data, create a comprehensive yet concise executive summary that covers:
  1. The brand's context, mission, and goals
  2. The naming process conducted
  3. Key findings from the analysis
  4. Top recommendations with rationale
  5. Strategic implications for the business

  Your executive summary should be professional, insightful, and targeted at C-level executives.
  Focus on business impact and strategic value rather than technical details.
  Maintain a formal tone appropriate for business documentation.

  Return your response as a JSON object with a "summary" field containing the full executive summary text (500-700 words) and 
  a "key_points" array with 5 important findings or recommendations.
