  Your task is to create concise summaries for each shortlisted brand name, highlighting their key strengths and alignment with the brand.

  Brand Context:
  ```
  {brand_context}
  ```

  Shortlisted Names:
  ```
  {shortlisted_names}
  ```

  Linguistic Analysis:
  ```
  {linguistic_analysis}
  ```

  Semantic Analysis:
  ```
  {semantic_analysis}
  ```

  For each shortlisted name (maximum 3 names), create a summary that includes:
  1. The name itself
  2. A one-sentence description of what the name communicates or represents
  3. 2-3 bullet points highlighting the name's key strengths based on the analysis data
  4. A brief explanation of how the name aligns with the brand's positioning and target audience

  Example format:
  ```
  **[Name]**: This name communicates [key message/concept]. 
  
  Key strengths:
  - [Strength 1 based on analysis]
  - [Strength 2 based on analysis]
  - [Strength 3 based on analysis]
  
  This name aligns with [specific aspect of brand positioning] and appeals to [target audience] by [specific benefit/quality].
  ```

  Keep each name summary concise (100-150 words maximum).
  Focus on concrete strengths backed by the analysis data.
  Highlight differentiation factors compared to typical competitor names.
  Emphasize business and strategic value rather than purely linguistic features.

  Return the summaries as a JSON object with the name as the key and the summary as the value:
  {
    "name1": "summary text",
    "name2": "summary text",
    "name3": "summary text"
  }
