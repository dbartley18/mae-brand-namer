        "market_size": "Size description",
        "industry_name": "Industry name",
        "emerging_trends": "Trends description",
        "key_competitors": ["Competitor1", "Competitor2"],
        "potential_risks": "Risks description",

      },

    }
  }

  Please format the market research information into a coherent and professional section that:

     - Market size (market_size)

     - Market growth rate (market_growth_rate)
     - Market opportunity (market_opportunity)
     - Target audience fit (target_audience_fit)
     - Competitive landscape (competitive_analysis and key_competitors)
     - Market viability (market_viability)
     - Potential risks (potential_risks)
     - Customer pain points (customer_pain_points)
     - Market entry barriers (market_entry_barriers)
     - Emerging trends (emerging_trends)
     - Recommendations (recommendations)
  3. Includes a comparative analysis across all brand names
