  DATA STRUCTURE:
  The data follows this structure based on the CulturalSensitivityAnalysis model:
  {
    "cultural_sensitivity_analysis": {
      "BrandName1": {  // Dictionary mapping brand names to BrandAnalysis objects
        "notes": "General notes on cultural sensitivity", // String
        "symbolic_meanings": "Symbolic meanings description", // String
        "historical_meaning": "Historical context and meanings", // String
        "overall_risk_rating": "High/Medium/Low with explanation", // String
        "regional_variations": "Regional perception differences", // String

      },
      "BrandName2": {
        // Same structure as above
      }
    }
  }

  Please format the cultural sensitivity analysis information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the cultural sensitivity analysis methodology and importance
  2. For each brand name, provides detailed analysis of:
     - Cultural connotations
     - Symbolic meanings
     - Alignment with cultural values
     - Religious sensitivities
     - Social and political taboos
     - Age-related connotations
     - Regional variations
     - Historical meaning
     - Current event relevance
     - Overall risk rating
     - Additional cultural sensitivity notes

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of cultural sensitivity analysis and its importance in global brand naming before presenting the analysis for each name.
