  Your task is to create a well-structured brand name evaluation section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Brand Name Evaluation Data: {{brand_name_evaluation}}

  The data is organized by brand name, with evaluation scores and comments for each name.

  Please format the brand name evaluation information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the evaluation methodology and scoring criteria
  2. Presents a ranked list of names based on overall score (descending order)
  3. For each name, provides:
     - Overall evaluation score
     - Shortlist status (whether the name is shortlisted)
     - Detailed evaluation comments
     - Strengths and weaknesses
  4. Highlights the top-performing names and explains why they scored well
  5. Provides a comparative analysis of shortlisted vs. non-shortlisted names

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of the evaluation process before presenting the analysis for each name.
