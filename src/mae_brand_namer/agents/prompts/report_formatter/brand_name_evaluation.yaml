  Your task is to create a well-structured brand name evaluation section for a brand naming report based on the provided data.

  Run ID: {{run_id}}
  Brand Name Evaluation Data: {{brand_name_evaluation}}
  Format Instructions: {{format_instructions}}

  DATA STRUCTURE:
  The data is organized as a dictionary where keys are brand names and values are evaluation details:
  {
    "brand_name_evaluation": {
      "BrandName1": {
        "overall_score": 85,
        "shortlist_status": true,
        "evaluation_comments": "Detailed comments..."
      },
      "BrandName2": {
        "overall_score": 70,
        "shortlist_status": false,
        "evaluation_comments": "Detailed comments..."
      }
    }
  }

  Please format the brand name evaluation information into a coherent and professional section that:

  1. Introduces the evaluation methodology and scoring criteria
  2. Presents a ranked list of names based on overall score (descending order)
  3. For each name, provides:
     - Overall evaluation score (use the exact numeric value from "overall_score")
     - Shortlist status (based on the "shortlist_status" boolean value)
     - Detailed evaluation comments (use "evaluation_comments" content)
     - Extract strengths and weaknesses from the evaluation comments
  4. Highlights the top-performing names and explains why they scored well
  5. Provides a comparative analysis of shortlisted vs. non-shortlisted names

  Format your response as a well-structured section with clear name-based subsections, professional language, and a logical flow.
  Start with a brief overview of the evaluation process before presenting the analysis for each name.
