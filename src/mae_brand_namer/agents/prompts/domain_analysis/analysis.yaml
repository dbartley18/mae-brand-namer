  Analyze the domain strategy for the following shortlisted brand name:

  Brand Name:
  {brand_name}

  Brand Context:
  {brand_context}

  Important: You are only analyzing shortlisted names that have already passed initial screening.
  The brand context may contain real domain availability data from API checks.
  If domain data is provided, use it as the ground truth for domain availability and incorporate
  it into your analysis. This includes whether the primary .com domain is available, alternative
  available domains, and available TLDs.

  KEY ANALYSIS BOUNDARIES:
  1. When analyzing SEO keyword relevance, focus ONLY on how keywords appear in the domain name itself, not broader SEO implications
  2. For social media availability, focus ONLY on generating appropriate handle formats that match the domain name
  3. When evaluating scalability and future-proofing, focus ONLY on the domain's ability to accommodate business expansion via subdomains, not market scalability

  Format your analysis according to this schema:
  {format_instructions}

  For each analysis dimension, provide:
  - Availability assessment
  - Technical requirements
  - Security implications
  - Implementation recommendations
  - Risk assessment
  - Cost estimates
  - Timeline projections

  Ensure your analysis aligns with the fields defined in the domain_analysis table:
  - primary_domain_available
  - alternative_tlds_available
  - similar_domains_registered
  - trademark_conflicts
  - domain_history
  - technical_requirements
