     - Trademark conflicts
     - Cybersquatting risks
     - Domain squatting history
     - Brand protection recommendations
     - Registration strategy
     - Portfolio management approach

  3. Technical Infrastructure
     - DNS configuration requirements
     - SSL/TLS certificate implications
     - Email deliverability assessment
     - SPF/DKIM compatibility

     - CDN compatibility
     - Infrastructure scalability

  4. Security Considerations
     - SSL implementation complexity
     - Security certificate requirements

  Format your analysis according to this schema:
  {format_instructions}

  For each analysis dimension, provide:
  - Availability assessment
  - Technical requirements
  - Security implications
  - Implementation recommendations
  - Risk assessment
  - Cost estimates
  - Timeline projections

  Ensure your analysis aligns with the fields defined in the domain_analysis table:
  - primary_domain_available
  - alternative_tlds_available
  - similar_domains_registered
  - trademark_conflicts
  - domain_history
  - technical_requirements
  - ssl_implications
  - email_deliverability
  - mobile_optimization
  - security_requirements
  - implementation_complexity
  - maintenance_needs
  - cost_estimate
  - registration_strategy
  - protection_recommendations
  - notes
  - rank

  Provide clear recommendations for domain strategy and next steps.
